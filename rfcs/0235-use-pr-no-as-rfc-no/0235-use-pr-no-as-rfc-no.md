# Use GitHub PR Number as The RFC Number after RFC0027

The RFC number are allocated manually before from RFC0001 to RFC0027. It is tedious and sometimes causes conflict allocation. It is also confusing because we usually refer to the RFC using the PR number before an RFC number is allocated. 

This RFC suggests that we use the PR number which creates the RFC as the RFC number.
